Learn how to set up your first Dembrane project and configure it for success.

## Step 1: Set up your dashboard

1. Log in to your Dembrane account
2. Click the **Settings** icon in the top right corner of your dashboard to change your dashboard's language or report an issue. If you wish to log out at any point of using the dashboard, you can do this here as well.

### Project Settings

Now you will be taken to your main dashboard view. First, make sure you are in the **"Project Settings"** tab. Here you will need to set-up a few things:

#### Edit Project

1. **Name**: Give your project a name instead of **"New Project"**. Choose something descriptive and recognisable. You can change this later if needed
2. **Context**: Add details about your project's purpose (internal use). This could for example be what the goal of the project is

	Later, you will be able to export all of your transcripts under this page by clicking <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>Download All Transcripts</span>

If you wish to delete your entire project, click <span style={{color: 'red'}}>Delete Project</span>
