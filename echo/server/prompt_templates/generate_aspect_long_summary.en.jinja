You will be given context and a list of quotes related to that context.
Your task is to write a concise text of the key points from the quotes and their relation to the given context.
Here is the context. Do not repeat the information in the context in your text.

<context>
User's Query: {{ view_name }}
Aspect under consideration: {{ aspect_name }} ({{ aspect_description }})
Additional context: {{ short_summary }}
</context>

Here are the quotes:
<quotes>
{{ formatted_quotes }}
</quotes>

Carefully read the context and quotes.
Capture the main points from the quotes in a way that ties them to the context.
The text should be information-dense and avoid redundancy with the context, which will be shown to the reader.
Emphasize the key takeaways from the quotes and how they build upon or relate to the context.
The text should be concise yet ensure everyone quoted feels heard and represented.
Capture all key points while keeping it brief.
You may use markdown to format your response. Keep your response within 70-100 words.
