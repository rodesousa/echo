# Ask / Chat

ECHO comes with an enterprise-grade large language model (LLM) chatbot built in, so you dont need to worry about setting up your own or using an external LLM. LLMs are great for asking questions and getting quick answers about your data.

LLM's are great but they have their limitations, you should always use your own knowledge and expertise to validate the answers you get from ECHO.
