# Library

The library is the place where you can create insights from ALL your conversations. Using a proprietary democratic sampling algorithm, we ensure every voice is heard and no single voice is overrepresented. 

The library has 2 tools:
- **Views**: Create perspectives on which to analyze the conversations.
- **Insights**: Explore insight clusters that ECHO has created from the conversations.

To get started, generate the library by clicking the button in the dashboard. This will take a few minutes so do it once you have collected all your conversations.

Once the library is generated, you can use it to create views and explore the insights.

## Views
A view is a perspective on which to analyze the conversations. A view allways has a title and a description, and contains a set of aspects. Click on a view to see all its aspects. Click on an aspect to see the quotes that inspired it.

Reccuring themes and Sentiment are two default aspects that are created when you generate the library. You can also create your own views using the "Create View" button.

When you create a view, you are creating a perspective on which to analyze the conversations. Often, its hard to come up with good views that arent different versions of "recurring themes" or "sentiment". Some good examples are:

**View on Core Values**
Title: "Core Values"
Description: "What principles and beliefs drive people's choices and opinions?"

**View on Challenges & Frustrations**
Title: "Challenges & Frustrations"
Description: "What problems, obstacles, or difficulties do people consistently mention?"

**View on Unmet Needs**
Title: "Unmet Needs"
Extra context: "What are people looking for or wishing they had?"

**View on Signs of Progress**
Query: "Signs of Progress"
Extra context: "How do people define and measure success?"

**View on Key Influences**
Query: "Key Influences"
Extra context: "What people, events, or experiences shape their thinking?"

**View on Aims & Aspirations**
Query: "Aims & Aspirations"
Extra context: "What are people trying to achieve or work toward?"

**View on Points of Reference**
Query: "Points of Reference"
Extra context: "What do people compare their experiences to?"

**View on Tools & Support**
Query: "Tools & Support"
Extra context: "What resources do people rely on or wish they had?"

You can create as many views as you want, and they will all be saved in the library. 


## Insights
Insights are clusters of insights that ECHO has created from the conversations. They are created by analyzing the conversations and finding patterns and themes. Click on an insight to see the conversations that it reffers to and the quotes that inspired it.
