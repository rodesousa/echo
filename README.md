# Dembrane ECHO

Dembrane ECHO is a transcription, analysis(sense-making) and reporting platform specifically designed for in-person multilingual conversations. It's a complete solution for real-world stakeholder-engagement scenarios where reliability and ease of use matter. ECHO was initially developed under a "move fast and break things" philosophy while serving pilot customers. Now, to better serve the public, we are transitioning to a privacy-first and security-first mentality.

### What Makes ECHO Different

While there are many transcription tools available, ECHO specifically excels at:
- Hybrid conversation transcription at scale (e.g. events, async feedback collection, breakout rooms)
- Multilingual support
- Real-time processing and analysis
- LLM chat and reporting functionality
- User-friendly interface designed for accessibility

We've built a complete solution for handling transcription in real-world scenarios where reliability and ease of use matter.

## Project Status

The project is actively maintained by Dembrane B.V. ([dembrane.com](https://dembrane.com)) and is now open to community contributions. We're committed to growing this codebase with the public sector community.

### Notes

- **Privacy & Security**: Please note that the current implementation was not initially built with privacy-by-design or security-by-design principles. We're actively working to improve these aspects and welcome contributions (PR's) in these areas.
- **Design Philosophy**: The initial version prioritized rapid development and real-world testing. The architecture emphasises a "tailwind" philosophy, with many functions co-located for AI first development.
